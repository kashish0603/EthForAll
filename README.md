Presenting you BondChain !!
A decentralized bond market where companies could issue bonds for the purpose of monetory funds. 

We at Bondchain would then mint a nft-bond for that company and fractionalize it required amount which would then be sold induvidually to investors who are willing to buy the bond. 

After all the fractionalized bond-nfts are sold out, people can then trade them amongst each other and will also receive the interest that is set by the company on a periodic basis
